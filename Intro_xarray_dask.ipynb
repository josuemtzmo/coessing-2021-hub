    "# Very brief introduction to the python libraries: `xarray` and `dask`\n",
    "\n",
    "- `xarray` is similar to the `pandas` library, but for multi-dimensional data. Whereas `pandas` works well with 2-d or tabular data, it is common in oceanography (at least in physical oceanography) to have 3-d or 4-d data (with 3 spatial dimensions and 1 time dimension). `xarray` is also very useful for analyzing large volumes of data often in netcdf (.nc) format.\n",
    "- `dask` is a library that parallelizes code (i.e. can run multiple computations at the same time) in a relatively easy and efficient way. It is very useful when using big data and integrates nicely with `xarray`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is meant to only be a *very brief* introduction to these two libraries, so you know where to start if you'd like to use these tools in your own research/coding. There are a few very nice tutorials online about both of these libraries, including these two by Ryan Abernathey:\n",

    "This is a dataset from 41 years of the CESM (Community Earth System Model) ocean model (\"POP\": Parallel Ocean Program). This dataset is stored on the Cloud through the Pangeo Project, and we can load it directly into this notebook that is running on the Cloud too! \n",
    "\n",
    "When we say \"load\" here, we actually don't load the entire dataset into memory. Instead, we do what is called \"lazy loading\", where we load only the dataset metadata initially. In this way, we can examine the dataset (which variables, size of variables, names of dimensions, etc.) without having to worry about how large the dataset is. This is very handy when using large datasets (such as the CESM dataset we will use here which is a whopping 5.6  terabytes!), since the dataset is too large to fit into any computer's memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "But, often we are only interested in one variable (say, sea surface temperature) or a specific spatial region or time frame, and so we only need a small subset of the larger dataset. `xarray` and `dask` allow us to work with large datasets and only load in the portion of the data that we actually are interested in, making it possible to do data analysis on very large datasets.\n",
